# About This Repo
This is a project for Mura-Mi's lecture of Java 8 new Features for my colleague.
API documents is written in Japanese because my colleagues are Japanese.

# How to Use / Read
This tutorial is organized by a solo eclipse project "java-h8-handson-gradle". As this name suggests, this project is able to be built using Gradle.
In source code, you can find comments with "TRY" keyword. The place "TRY" appears has incomplete part, refactorable idiom or unimplemented stub methods. You can learn Java8 features by solving TRY comments.
